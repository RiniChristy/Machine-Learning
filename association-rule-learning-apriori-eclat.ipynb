There are three common ways to measure association.\n","\n","**Support.** This says how popular an itemset is, as measured by the proportion of transactions in which an itemset appears. In the list below, the support of {apple} is 4 out of 8, or 50%. Itemsets can also contain multiple items. For instance, the support of {apple, beer, rice} is 2 out of 8, or 25%.\n","Support(apple)= 4/8 = 50%\n","support{apple, beer, rice} = 2/8 = 25%\n","\n","* List 1: Apple, Beer, Rice, Ham\n","* List 2:  Apple, Beer, Rice\n","* List 3: Apple, Beer\n","* List 4: Apple, Pear\n","* List 5: Milk, Beer, Rice, Ham\n","* List 6: Milk, Beer, Rice\n","* List 7: Milk, Beer\n","* List 8: Milk, Pear\n","\n","**Confidence.** This says how likely item Y is purchased when item X is purchased, expressed as {X -> Y}. This is measured by the proportion of transactions with item X, in which item Y also appears. In the above list, the confidence of {apple -> beer} is 3 out of 4, or 75%.\n","\n","Support(X, Y)/ (Support (X) \n","\n","One drawback of the confidence measure is that it might misrepresent the importance of an association. This is because it only accounts for how popular apples are, but not beers. If beers are also very popular in general, there will be a higher chance that a transaction containing apples will also contain beers, thus inflating the confidence measure. To account for the base popularity of both constituent items,a third measure called lift is used.\n","\n","**Lift.** This says how likely item Y is purchased when item X is purchased, while controlling for how popular item Y is. In Table 1, the lift of {apple -> beer} is 1, which implies no association between items. A lift value greater than 1 means that item Y is likely to be bought if item X is bought, while a value less than 1 means that item Y is unlikely to be bought if item X is bought.\n","\n","Lift(X -> Y) = Support(X, Y)/ (Support (X) x SupportY))
